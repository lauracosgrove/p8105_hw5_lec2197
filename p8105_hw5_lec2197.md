Problem 1
---------

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

  )
```

The experimental group shows a general trend of increase over time, while the control group's trend is largely static.
